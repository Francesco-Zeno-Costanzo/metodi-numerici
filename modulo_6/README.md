# Modulo 6

The purpose of the module is to study the thermodynamics of a scalar field with the same techniques as in module 3.

campo2d.f and par2d.f are the codes for the montecarlo simulation.

analisi.f is the code for compute the error over the quantities returned by simulation.

plot.py il code for some plot and fit e.g. continuum limit.

anaomaliatraccia.py calculates the energy through the trace anomaly method.
